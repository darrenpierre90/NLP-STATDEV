2,"Effective with the September 2018 release of the wholesale trade estimates on November 21st 2018, wholesale sales estimates disseminated by Manufacturing and Wholesale Trade Division have been converted from a 2007 reference year to a 2012 reference year for its volume and price estimates. Constant price estimates and their associated price index are now using 2012 as their base year.  Adopting a new reference year didn't affect constant dollars sales estimates growth rates over the period 2004 to 2011 as it represents a rescaling of the 2007-based data. However, levels and growth rates of the estimates for the period of 2012 to date have been affected by revisions to estimates at current prices and to price indices."
